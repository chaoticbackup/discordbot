He or she may not move another Creature until the mandated movement action is satisfied.",
                "8.7.4.3": "If a player has multiple mandatory actions that would need to be fulfilled simultaneously the player may choose which action to fulfill first. If after that action is taken the other mandatory action remains that action must be taken at the next legal opportunity.",
                "8.7.4.4": "Players are not required to take optional actions that would allow them to fulfill mandatory actions in the future. The requirement to fulfill a legal mandatory action only applies to the current game state.",
                "8.7.4.5": "If, after completing a mandatory action that requirement remains, a player must complete the action at the first legal opportunity until the requirement ends.",

            "8.8.1": "Cumulative Abilities",
                "8.8.1.1": "Cumulative abilities are abilities that reference a specific number as part of their ability structure. Creature abilities of the form [Ability] X are cumulative abilities. Current examples of cumulative abilities are: Strike, Recklessness, Intimidate, Element X, Elementproof, Exhaust, Outperform, Support, and Swift.",
                "8.8.1.2": "When a Creature with a cumulative ability gains or loses another copy of the same ability the numerical values of X are combined to generate a final value for that ability. The combined abilities are then treated as one ability with that final value of X for all game purposes.",
                "8.8.1.3": "Any final value of X less than 0 will be treated as 0 for all game purposes. When a cumulative ability has its X value reduced to 0 this ability is considered to be removed from the Creature Card in question while X remains 0.",
                "8.8.1.4": "If a temporary effect reduces the value of a cumulative ability to less than 0 only that portion of the ability actually removed will be restored when that effect ends. \nExample: A Creature with Fire 10 loses Fire 15 until end of turn. This reduces X to 0. At the end of the turn the effect ends and the value of Fire X returns to 10.",
            "8.8.2": "Replacement abilities",
                "8.8.2.1": "Some abilities state that a given action happens “instead” of another game event. These abilities are known as replacement abilities.",
                "8.8.2.2": "All replacement abilities use the word instead somewhere in their text. If this word is not present then the ability is not a replacement ability.",
                "8.8.2.3": "Replacement abilities completely replace the initial game event with the indicated action. The original game event is considered not to have occurred.",
                "8.8.2.4": "If two or more replacement abilities apply to the same game event then the player who controls the affected card or ability chooses the order in which to apply the replacements. Any replacement ability that no longer applies to the replaced event has no effect.",
                "8.8.2.5": "Each replacement ability is only applied once for any particular initial game event. Replacement abilities never apply to themselves.",
            "8.8.3": "Innate Abilities",
                "8.8.3.1": "An Innate Ability is one which does not have any cost to perform and which does not give a specific time which it occurs. The term “Innate Ability” describes a class of abilities and particular Innate Abilities may also have other ability designations. For example, many Innate Abilities are also cumulative abilities.",
                "8.8.3.2": "Examples of Innate Abilities are Swift, Range, and Element X.",
        "8.9": "Duration of Abilities",
            "8.9.1": "All abilities in the game have an associated duration for the effects that they generate. Unless a card specifies otherwise all effects generated by activated abilities, Triggered Abilities, Attack Cards, and mugic end at the end of the turn in which they were generated. Counters placed on cards remain between turns unless otherwise stated.",
            "8.9.2": "Unless otherwise stated effects generated by innate card abilities last until that card is no longer in play.",
    "9": "Specific Ability Rules",
        "9.1": "Infection",
            "9.1.1": "Infection is a binary Creature state. A Creature is either Infected or Uninfected.",

                "9.1.2.1": "Creatures are by default Uninfected and may become Infected by card effects.",
                "9.1.2.2": "If a card effect says to Infect a Creature, place a Parasite token on that Creature.",
                "9.1.2.3": "Infected Creatures are always marked with Parasite tokens. These may be Parasite cards or any other distinguishable marker.",

                "9.1.3.2": "To Uninfect a Creature as a cost, that Creature must be Infected. You may not pay an Uninfect cost using an Uninfected Creature.",
                "9.1.3.3": "Mugic and abilities that Uninfect Creatures when they resolve may be targeted at Uninfected Creatures. When they resolve the Uninfect portion of the mugic or ability will do nothing.",
            "9.1.4": "Parasite Tokens",
                "9.1.4.1": "When an effect results in a Creature becoming Infected a Parasite token is placed on that Creature.",
                "9.1.4.2": "Parasite tokens are not considered cards in Chaotic. They are simply visual indicators that a Creature is Infected.",
                "9.1.4.3": "If a Creature with a Parasite goes to the Discard pile any Parasite tokens on that Creature are removed from the game. This happens simultaneously with the Creature being placed in the Discard pile.",
        "9.2": "Brainwashed",
            "9.2.1": "Creatures with the Minion Creature type have Brainwashed text. These Creatures are considered to have two separate game text boxes, only one of which is active at any time while the Creature is in play. The first of these is called the Normal text, while the second is called Brainwashed text.",
            "9.2.2": "A Creature with Brainwashed has its Normal card text active unless its controller also controls a Chieftain Creature or a card effect activates the Brainwashed text. While a card’s Brainwashed text is active, its Normal text is inactive, and vise versa.",
            "9.2.3": "Inactive text is not considered to be present on the card for any game purpose. Example: A Creature with the Brainwashed text of “Swift 1” is being played in an army which does not control a Creature with the type of “Chieftain.” This Creature may not move an additional space during a move and may not be targeted by effects which require the target to have Swift.",
            "9.2.4": "While a Creature’s Brainwashed text is active that Creature may only play Generic Mugic cards.",
            "9.2.5": "While a Creature is in the Discard pile, the card is considered to have both the Normal and Brainwashed text boxes. For example, if a Creature in the Discard pile has “Defender” in its Brainwashed text box, an effect which returns a Creature with Defender from the Discard pile to play would be able to return that Creature whether or not its controller also controls a Chieftain.",
        "9.3": "Mirage",
            "9.3.1": "Mirage is both a Location subtype and an ability keyword. A Location Card with the Mirage subtype is referred to as a Mirage Location and these Locations have the Mirage keyword. Mirage is an Innate keyword ability that is written in the form Mirage: effect.",
            "9.3.2": "Mirage represents two independent abilities. The first of these applies while the Mirage Location Card is the Active Location. In this case the Mirage ability means “If this Location would be placed on the bottom of your Location Deck, instead put it onto the Battleboard in any space. Any other Mirage Location on the Battleboard at this time is returned to the bottom of its owner’s Location Deck.” This ability does not start a Burst and cannot be responded to. The Mirage Location will remain in the chosen space until removed by another Mirage Location or other game effect.",
            "9.3.3": "The text after the “Mirage:” on a Mirage card is the Mirage text. This text is active while the Mirage is in a Battleboard space. While a Mirage is the active location, Mirage text is inactive.",
            "9.3.4": "While a Mirage Location Card is on the Battleboard it is not treated as the Active Location and any other rules text on the Mirage Location is inactive. In addition the Mirage Location is not considered to be a part of a player’s Location Deck while it is on the Battleboard. However, it is still considered a Location Card for the purposes of other game effects and abilities.",
            "9.3.5": "The Mirage text of a Mirage Location only applies to the space that the Mirage Location occupies, Creatures occupying that space on the Battleboard, or to Combats occurring in that space.",
            "9.3.6": "The Mirage text of a Mirage Location may create an effect in its Battleboard space that can be applied to cards outside of that space. Such an effect is applied even if the affected card is not in the Mirage location.",
        "9.4": "Invisibility",
            "9.4.1": "Invisibility is an Innate ability written in the form “Invisibility: ability” that indicates the Creature has the listed ability against creatures without Invisibility. For example, a creature with Invisibility: Surprise wins initiative checks against creatures without Invisibility.",
            "9.4.2": "If an effect causes a Creature to lose Invisibility, that creature loses all abilities tagged with the Invisibility keyword. For example, if a creature has “Invisibility: Strike 15” and “Invisibility: Surprise”, an effect that causes it to lose Invisibility will remove both abilities.",
            "9.4.3": "If an effect causes an individual creature to lose Invisibility, that creature is not considered to have Invisibility for purposes of evaluating Invisibility on opposing creatures. For example, if a Prince Mudeenu with Spectral Viewer is engaged with an unequipped Prince Mudeenu, the Prince with Spectral Viewer will deal an additional 20 damage with its first attack due to Invisibility: Strike 20.",
            "9.4.4": "Invisibility effects that go on the burst check for Invisibility of the opposing creature both on announcement and resolution. For example, if a creature with Invisibility: Disarm is engaged with another creature with Invisibility, at the start of combat Disarm will not go on the burst. If a creature with Invisibility: Disarm is engaged with a creature without Invisibility, Disarm will go on the burst at start of combat. If the opposing creature then gains Invisibility before the Disarm effect resolves, the creature’s battlegear will not lose abilities when the effect resolves.",

        "10.1": "Apprentice is a simplified version of the game that doesn’t use Battlegear or Mugic. All game text on Creatures, Locations, and attacks is ignored.",
        "10.2": "Advanced Apprentice is a version of the game in which players never receive priority except to play an Attack Card. Battlegear is used as well as the rules text of Creatures, Locations, and attacks, but players may not play Mugic or activated abilities.",
        "10.3": "Masters is the standard version of the game. The comprehensive rules are designed to describe a Masters game of Chaotic.",
        "10.4": "Limited is a version of the game in which players open an assortment of random cards and use them to construct decks.",
            "10.4.1": "A game of Limited follows Masters rules with a Game Size of 3 (see 2.1.1), a 5-card Location Deck, and a 10-card Attack Deck."
