    "2.1": "Each player needs his or her own deck to play Chaotic."
    "2.1.1": "Game Size: Prior to the start of the game, players determine the size of the game to be played. The size of the game represents the number of Creatures on each player’s team, the size of the Battleboard (see 2.1.2), and the number of Battlegear and Mugic Cards used."
    "2.1.2": "Battleboard: Games in Chaotic take place on a Battleboard"", or play area, of two opposed triangles joined at their base. Each subsequent row of spaces in these triangles has one less available space than the preceding row. The Battleboards have 1, 3, or 6 total spaces per player. Any game size that results in all available spaces on such a grid being filled by a Creature Card at the start of the game is allowed. Currently 1 vs. 1, 3 vs. 3, and 6 vs. 6 battles are the most common, but larger games are possible."

    "2.2.2.1": "Version: The line below the name (if any) is the version. Different versions will have different abilities, but are considered the same card for deck construction. \nExample: A player may have up to two copies of Tangath Toborn, up to two copies of Tangath Toborn in Training, or one copy of each, but may not have any combination of three or more cards with the name Tangath Toborn."
    "2.2.3": "Unique: Some cards are \“Unique\”. A player may not include more than one Unique card with the same name in a deck. A Unique card may not be played with any other version of the card, regardless of whether or not the other version is Unique."

    "2.2.5": "Loyal: Some cards have the restriction \“Can not join mixed armies\” or \“Loyal.\” These cards can only be played with Creatures that share their tribal affiliation, or Creatures with specified characteristics. \nExample: Nimmei is a Danian creature with \“Loyal\”. All Creatures in a deck with Nimmei must be Danian. Gan’trak is a M’arrillian creature with \“Loyal – M’arrillians or Minions\”. All creatures in a deck with Gan’trak must either be from the M’arrillian tribe or have the Minion subtype."

    "3.1.1.1": "Any time a card refers to its own name in its game text, it means that card itself. \nExample: Lomma has the ability \“The first attack against Lomma each combat deals 10 less damage.\” Even if a player had a second copy of Lomma in play, each ability would only affect the creature it is printed on."
    "3.1.2": "Version – A card’s version is found below the name."

For example, Muge’s Edge says \“If your engaged Creature is a Muge, deal 10 damage.\” Lord van Bloot has the subtypes \“Conqueror Muge\”. Because one of his subtypes is Muge, Muge’s Edge will deal 10 damage."

    "3.2.9.3": "Whenever a creature has taken damage equal to or greater than its Energy, that creature is destroyed and placed in the discard pile. (See 8.7.3)"
    "3.2.9.4": "Effects which refer to a Creature’s Current Energy look at the sum of the Creature’s Scanned Energy modified by any existing effects, minus the damage on the creature. \nFor example, a creature with 45 Scanned Energy equipped with Kha’rall Husk Armor which gives an additional 50 Energy that has taken 55 damage has a Current Energy of 40."

    "3.4.4": "Subtypes - A Mugic’s subtypes are on the type line in the center of the card after the type."
    "3.4.4.1": "The first subtype for each Mugic Card is its affiliation. To play a Mugic Card, a creature must possess the characteristic indicated in the Mugic’s affiliation. \nExample: Tangath Toborn, Tangath in Training is an OverWorld creature. Therefore he can play \“Rhyme of the Reckless\”, which is \“Mugic – OverWorld\” but he cannot play \“Canon of Casualty\”, which is \“Mugic – UnderWorld.\”"
    "3.4.4.2": "The affiliation “Generic” means that any Creature can play that Mugic Card."

    "3.5.8.1.1": "An attack with an Elemental Type is referred to as an attack of that type. \nExample: Rustoxic has the Earth and Water Elemental Types. Therefore it is considered both an \“Earth attack\” and a \“Water attack\”"
    "3.5.8.1.2": "An attack with any Elemental Type is considered an elemental attack.
    "3.5.8.2": "An attack is considered to have a Discipline Type if its game text includes a Stat Check, Stat Fail, or Challenge of that Discipline Type.

    "4.1.7": "Battleboard Sides. The Battleboard spaces filled by a player’s Creatures at the start of a game are considered to be that player’s \“side\” of the Battleboard. Battleboard spaces filled by an opponent’s Creatures at the start of a game are considered to be that opponent’s \“side\” of the Battleboard. Unfilled Battleboard spaces (such as excess spaces on a 6v6 playmat during a 3v3 game) are not used during a game, and Creatures may not move into them."
    "4.2.1": "Starting Player Determination. Once players have performed all of the game set-up actions they must determine who plays first.

    "6.2.1": "At the start of the Location step, the top Location in the Active Player’s Location Deck is turned face up. This Location replaces any existing face up Location and becomes the current active Location. Any replaced Location is placed on the bottom of its owner’s Location Deck. The Innate Abilities (see 8.8.3) of the current active Location take effect immediately."
    "6.2.2": "Next any abilities triggered by the Location being revealed are handled. These abilities form the start of a Burst (see 8.2). The Active Player places abilities from cards he controls onto the Burst first, followed by the Non-Active Player. If a player controls more than one ability, he or she may place them onto the Burst in any order. The Active Player then gets priority to add Mugic or abilities to the Burst."
    "6.2.3": "After the Location has been turned face up and generated abilities have been resolved the Active Player receives priority to play Mugic or card abilities"
    "6.2.4": "If all players pass in order and the Burst is empty then the game moves to the Action Step"
    "6.2.5": "Only one Location may be revealed at a time. If a new Location is revealed during the course of a turn, the existing face up Location is placed at the bottom of its owner’s Location Deck. The revealed Location is the active Location and its abilities are applied immediately"
    "6.3.1": "During the Action Step the Active Player must move at least one Creature, and may then move any number of other Creatures he controls in any order."
    "6.3.2": "After a move action resolves, the active player receives priority to play Mugic or abilities. The next creature cannot move until both players pass on an empty burst. (See 8.2)"
    "6.3.3": "A Creature moves by entering an adjacent space on the Battleboard. Each Creature’s move must be fully completed prior to the next Creature’s move. No player receives priority during a move action."

    "6.3.3.2": "To move a Swift Creature, there must be a path of unoccupied spaces between the Creature’s starting space and its destination (unless the Creature has \“Range\” as noted below). The Creature is not considered to have entered the intervening spaces."
    "6.3.3.3": "Creatures with the \“Range\” ability may move through spaces occupied by friendly or enemy Creatures as if those Creatures were not present. However a Creature with one of these abilities may not end its move in an occupied space unless it initiates combat."
    "6.3.4": "If a Creature ends its move in a space occupied by an opposing Creature, a Combat is initiated (see section 7.0). The battle is considered to be taking place in the space on the Battleboard where both Creatures now are. The Creature that wins this battle remains on the Battleboard in that space."
    "6.3.4.1": "Defender and Intercepting: After the Active Player has initiated a battle by moving a Creature into a space occupied by an opposing Creature, the controller of that Creature has the opportunity to intercept the moving Creature using Creatures with the Defender ability. This process is handled as follows."
    "6.3.4.1.1": "Creatures with the Defender ability may be used to intercept a moving Creature by taking the place of the Creature whose space was entered. If a Creature with Defender is adjacent to the space in which a battle is to take place that Creature may intercept the move by switching places with the Creature currently occupying that space. This is an optional ability and a player may choose not to intercept a move."
    "6.3.4.1.2": "If a creature has Defender: (characteristic), it may only swap places with a Creature with that characteristic. \nFor example, a creature with Defender: Conjurers may only intercept for a creature with the Creature subtype Conjurer."
    "6.3.4.1.3": "Defender is an Innate Ability (see 8.8.3) and its use does not create a Burst."
    "6.3.4.1.4": "Only one Creature with Defender may be used to intercept any given move. If there is more than one Creature with Defender adjacent to the space of the battle then the Non-Active Player must choose one of these Creatures to be the intercepting Creature. Once this choice is made no other Creatures may be used to intercept in this combat."
    "6.3.4.1.5": "Once a Creature with Defender has been selected to intercept a move it exchanges position with the Creature whose space is being entered. After this exchange is made any abilities that trigger \“when a Creature intercepts\” are added to the Beginning of Combat Burst."
    "6.3.4.1.6": "A Creature that exchanges positions as the result of the use of Defender is treated as having entered a space on the Battleboard for the purposes of any abilities that trigger when a Creature enters a space. These abilities are generated at the same time as any events which are triggered upon interception and are placed on the same Burst."
    "6.3.4.1.7": "Once interception has taken place the game continues with the Combat Step."
    "6.3.5": "A player may only initiate one combat each turn. If a player has already initiated a combat during a turn, his or her Creatures may no longer end their moves in a space on the Battleboard occupied by an opposing Creature."
    "6.3.6": "Once a player has moved at least one Creature and is no longer willing or able to move additional Creatures, the game checks for a Showdown."
    "6.3.7.1": "At the end of a player’s Action Step, if no Creature controlled by that player has been involved in a combat this turn or the two previous turns (including the opponent’s last turn), he or she is required to initiate a Showdown using the procedure given below."
    "6.3.7.2": "A Showdown is initiated using the following steps: \nThe Active Player selects one Creature controlled by the Non-Active Player. \nThe Non-Active Player selects one Creature controlled by the Active Player. \nThe Active Player’s Creature in placed into the other Creature’s space. \nCreatures may not use any Defender abilities. \nThe Creatures become engaged and a combat is initiated between them as per the combat rules in 8.0 except that at the conclusion of the End of Combat step (Section 8.3) the game progresses into the Recovery Step rather than the Action Step."
    "6.4.1": "The last step in a player’s turn is the Recovery Step. During the Recovery Step the following events occur simultaneously. \n1) All damage is removed from Creatures in play. \n2) All effects that last “until end of turn” end. Any effects which are not tracked by a card or counter and don’t have a specified duration also end now. All such effects end simultaneously and cannot result in a Creature being destroyed. \n3) The current active Location is placed on the bottom of its owner’s Location Deck. All effects of that Location end immediately. If that location was a Mirage location, it is placed into play on the Battleboard instead."
    "6.4.2": "No player receives priority in the Recovery Step"
    "6.4.3": "After all of the above actions have been taken the turn ends and the next player in the turn order becomes the Active Player."
    "7.1": "Combat is a substep in a player’s Action Step. It is entered when a player initiates a Battle between one of his Creatures and an opponent’s Creature. Like the main turn, combat is also handled in a series of phases as described below."
    "7.2": "Phases in the Combat Substep \nThe phases in the combat substep occur in the following order: \nEngagement \nReveal Battlegear \nBeginning of Combat \nInitiative \nStrike Phase"
    "7.2.1": "Engagement: The two Creatures in combat are now considered \“engaged\” for the duration of the combat. There is no priority point in this substep. Effects which trigger when creatures become engaged wait until the Beginning of Combat substep to go on the burst."
    "7.2.2": 'Reveal Battlegear: Any engaged Creature with a face down Battlegear has that Battlegear turned face up. There is no priority point in this substep. Effects which trigger when Battlgear is revealed wait until the Beginning of Combat substep to go on the burst."
    "7.2.3": "Beginning of Combat: Any effects which are generated by the beginning of combat, Creatures becoming engaged, Battlegear being revealed, or a Creature being intercepted are now added to the Burst with the Active player adding his/her effects first. The Active player then receives priority. When both players pass in order on an empty burst (see 8.2), the game progresses to the Initiative phase"
    "7.2.4.1": "Determine Initiative: Players now determine which player’s Creature has the Initiative in the combat. The player who controls the Creature with Initiative will be the first Striking Player. Keep checking steps in the order below until exactly one creature qualifies for Initiative. Once a Creature gains Initiative no further steps are checked: \n1)Any Creature with the Surprise ability. If both players’ Creatures have this ability then the Initiative check moves to 2). \n2)If a Creature has \“loses Initiative checks\” then the opponent’s Creature gains Initiative. If both players’ Creatures have this ability then the Initiative check moves to 3) \n3)The active Location lists an attribute in the form \“Initiative: Characteristic.\” The attribute is a value (e.g. Wisdom, Scanned Energy) or other card characteristic (e.g. Fire, OverWorld, etc.). Whichever engaged creature has a higher statistic or has the listed characteristic gains Initiative. In the event of a tie move to 4) \n4)The Creature controlled by the Active Player gains Initiative."
    "7.2.4.2": "After Initiative is determined the game moves to the Strike phase."
    "7.2.5": "Strike Phase: During the Strike phase the player with Initiative begins as the Striking Player. The other player is considered the Non-Striking Player."
    "7.2.5.1": "The Striking Player draws the top card of his Attack Deck. If a player has no cards remaining in their Attack Deck, that player shuffles his attack discard pile to form a new Attack Deck, and then play,proceeds as above with the refreshed deck."
    "7.2.5.2": "The Striking Player picks an Attack Card from his hand to play. This attack starts a new Burst known as the \“Attack Burst\” and is considered to have been played by the engaged Creature controlled by the Striking Player. That player pays any costs associated with the Attack Card."
    "7.2.5.3": "Once the Attack Card has been successfully played, the Striking Player receives priority to play abilities or Mugic and the Burst proceeds as normal."
    "7.2.5.4": "When both players pass in order the Attack Burst resolves, and the Striking player receives priority. Once both players pass on an empty burst, the next player becomes the Striking player and this process is repeated until one creature leaves play and combat ends (see 7.3)."
    "7.3.1": "Combat will end when one player’s Creature leaves play (either by being destroyed, sacrificed, or by taking damage equal to or exceeding its Energy). When this occurs, all effects on the current Burst continue to resolve until that Burst is concluded. The one exception to this rule is if a player wins and the game ends (see section 5.0)."
    "7.3.2": "Combat can also end if both players play twenty consecutive attacks each without dealing damage. When this occurs, both engaged creatures are defeated and combat ends."
    "7.3.3": "Once combat ends, the game returns to Active Player’s Action step."
    "8.1.1": "Players may only play abilities or Mugic when allowed by the game rules. These opportunities are defined by the rules stating that the Active (or Non-Active) player is allowed to play abilities or Mugic. This is also referred to as a player receiving priority."
    "8.1.2": "When allowed to by the game rules, the player with priority has the option to use Mugic or play a card ability. If the player chooses to use Mugic, or to play an activated ability, this starts a Burst or extends an existing Burst, which is handled as described below. Alternatively, the player with priority may \“pass\”. In this case the player’s opponent receives priority as above. If both players \“pass\” in succession then the opportunity to play abilities or Mugic has passed and the game progresses as described in the section for that particular game phase."
    "8.2": "Bursts A Burst represents one or more unresolved Mugic or card abilities, which will resolve in the reverse order to which they were added to the Burst."
    "8.2.1": "Starting a Burst: A Burst is started each time a player uses Mugic or plays a card ability. Bursts may also be started by certain card abilities that occur automatically at a time defined by that ability (For Example: At the beginning of combat). In addition the play of an Attack Card during the strike phase starts a Burst. The Mugic, Attack Card, or card ability used to start the Burst becomes the first effect in a given Burst."
    "8.2.2.1": "Starting with the opponent of the player who started the Burst, players alternately decide to either extend the Burst by playing their own Mugic Card or ability, or to \“pass\”. If a player decides to pass then his or her opponent receives the choice to play a Mugic Card or ability, or to pass. If a player chooses to add a Mugic or ability to the Burst then the previous procedure repeats with his or her opponent receiving the first choice to extend the Burst. Otherwise, if both players choose to \“pass\” in a row, then the Burst will begin to resolve. Any Triggered Abilities generated during the resolution of the Burst are immediately added to the Burst, and both players (starting with the Active Player) will receive priority to respond with additional Mugic Cards or abilities. Additional effects are added to the Burst until both players pass consecutively, after which the Burst will continue to resolve."
    "8.2.3.1": "Effects on a Burst will resolve in the reverse order to which they were added to the Burst. This is commonly referred to as \“Last In, First Out\” order. Starting with the most recently added ability or Mugic, the effect of each item on the Burst is completely resolved prior to the resolution of the next effect on the Burst."
    "8.2.3.2": "When effects resolve the cards representing them are removed from the Burst. Resolved Mugic Cards are placed in the general discard pile and resolved Attack Cards are placed into the attack discard pile. Resolved card abilities, which have no physical card representation, are simply removed from the Burst."
    "8.2.3.3": "During the resolution of a Burst no player receives priority to play abilities or Mugic unless a Triggered Ability is generated. Any abilities that trigger during the resolution of a Burst are handled as described below (see 8.3.4)."
    "8.2.3.4": "Once a Burst is fully resolved the active player receives priority to play Mugic or card abilities as per 9.1."
    "8.2.3.5": "Card abilities in a Burst are independent of the card that created them. Destruction of this card will not remove the generated ability from the Burst or cause it to fail to resolve.",
    "8.3.1": "A Triggered Ability is one which gives a specific time or event which causes the ability to be triggered. When the indicated time or event occurs these abilities are added to the Burst. Typically Triggered Abilities are written in the format \“When [event] ....\” Or \“At [time] ....\”."
    "8.3.2": "A Triggered Ability results in the creation of a Burst if one is not currently open. If more than one ability is triggered by the same game event then the Active Player adds his or her abilities to the Burst first. These can be added in any order. Then the Non-Active Player then adds abilities in a similar manner."
    "8.3.3": "When more than one triggered ability would be added to the Burst at the same time, the **Active Player** adds all of theirs to the Burst in any order they choose. Then the non-Active Player adds their in any order they choose. Meaning the non-active player's abilities will always be on top.\nE.G. If it's your turn with your Numin, you choose how to order them. You put Numin on top of your element gain, Numin resolves first and then you get your element. If your opponent has Numin, they put any abilities after your Numin, and they lose their elements.\nSee Comprehensive Rules 8.3.3 and 7.2.3",
    "8.3.4": "If a Triggered Ability is generated while a Burst is being built, that ability is added to the Burst prior to either player being able to extend that Burst. If more then one ability is generated by the same game event then the Active Player adds all of his or her abilities in the order of his or her choice first followed by the Non-Active Player. The Burst can then be extended as normal following the procedure in 8.2.2 with the player who has the choice of action being the one who would have had that choice in the absence of the addition of Triggered Abilities.",
    "8.4": "Playing Mugic, Attack Cards, or Abilities:"
    "8.4.1": "Mugic Cards or card abilities are played by performing the following set of actions in the order indicated below:"
    "8.4.1.1": "Reveal the Mugic Card or announce the ability that you want to play."
    "8.4.1.2": "If the Mugic or ability has a variable cost the value of X is chosen now (see 8.4.2.6)"
    "8.4.1.3": "If the Mugic or ability has targets these are chosen now."
    "8.4.1.4": "Pay any cost associated with playing the Mugic Card or ability. If you cannot pay the full cost for the ability or Mugic then the announcement is canceled and all steps taken are reversed."
    "8.4.1.5": "Place a played Mugic Card on the table as part of the Burst. Played abilities are also added to the Burst but are not represented by physical cards."
    "8.4.2.1": "All Mugic Cards have a \“Mugic cost\”. This cost is printed in the text box of the Mugic Card and indicates how many Mugic counters a player must remove from one of his or her Creatures to play that Mugic."
    "8.4.2.2": "In order to play a Mugic Card a player must remove counters equal to the Mugic cost from a single Creature he/she controls that shares a characteristic with the Mugic Card to be played."
    "8.4.2.3": "The cost for Generic Mugic Cards may be paid by Creatures of any Tribe."
    "8.4.2.4": "Mugic Cards may have costs given on the Mugic Card in addition to the Mugic counter removal cost. If this is the case all additional costs must also be paid in order to play the Mugic Card. Game effects may also modify the number of Mugic counters that are required to play a Mugic."
    "8.4.2.5": "Some Mugic Cards have a cost of 0. These Mugic Cards do not require the removal of a Mugic counter to play. However, these cards still require the player to select a Creature with the appropriate characteristics to play them."
    "8.4.2.6": "If a Mugic Card has a cost of X this indicates that the cost of the Mugic is variable. When playing these Mugic Cards the casting player must decide a value for X as the Mugic is being declared. The cost of the Mugic becomes that chosen value and that number of counters must be removed from a Creature the casting player controls that shares a characteristic with the Mugic. Any text effects of the Mugic use the chosen value of X when it resolves."
    "8.4.3": "Attack Cards are played by performing the following set of actions in the order described below."
    "8.4.3.1": "The striking player chooses an Attack Card form his or her hand and announces it as the Attack that they are playing."
    "8.4.3.2": "The striking player pays any associated costs for playing the Attack Card. If the cost can not be met the Attack Card announcement is cancelled and the Striking player must choose another Attack Card to play."
    "8.4.3.3": "The Attack Card is placed onto the Attack Burst."
    "8.4.4.1": "All activated card abilities have an associated cost to perform. These costs can be Mugic counters, sacrifices, or other payments. In all cases, the cost must be paid in order to play the indicated ability. If the ability cost involves removal of a Mugic counter this counter must come from the Creature with the associated ability."
    "8.4.4.2": "Triggered Abilities and Innate Abilities do not have costs to play."
    "8.4.5": "Attack Cards do not have any innate associated cost to play. Any Attack Card may be played by any Creature."
    "8.5": "Resolution of Mugic and abilities: When a Mugic Card or ability on a Burst resolves it does so in the following manner."
    "8.5.1": "First any targets of the Mugic or ability are rechecked to see if they are legal. If no targets are still legal then the Mugic or ability fails to resolve and is removed from the Burst."
    "8.5.2": "All instructions of the Mugic or ability are carried out in the order in which they are written. Any targets of the ability which are no longer valid can not be affected by any targeted portion of the resolving ability. Any instruction which references a Creature that is not associated with a specified target (for example “this Creature”) refers to the Creature which played the Mugic or ability."
    "8.5.3": "Any damage dealt to a Creature is added to that Creature’s total damage. Damage dealt to a Creature is cumulative during a player’s turn. Damage is not removed from a Creature until the turn ends."
    "8.5.4": "The amount of damage dealt by Mugic or an ability is determined as follows. First the Base Damage is modified by effects that increase damage. Any effects that add a specific amount of damage are calculated first, followed by any effects that multiply damage dealt. Then any effects that reduce damage are applied. These are applied in reverse order to the above with any division effects applied first followed by any effects that reduce the damage dealt by a specific number. Finally any effect that sets damage done to a specific number is applied."
