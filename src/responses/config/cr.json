    "7.2.4.2": "After Initiative is determined the game moves to the Strike phase.",
    "7.2.5": "Strike Phase: During the Strike phase the player with Initiative begins as the Striking Player. The other player is considered the Non-Striking Player.",
    "7.2.5.1": "The Striking Player draws the top card of his Attack Deck. If a player has no cards remaining in their Attack Deck, that player shuffles his attack discard pile to form a new Attack Deck, and then play,proceeds as above with the refreshed deck.",
    "7.2.5.2": "The Striking Player picks an Attack Card from his hand to play. This attack starts a new Burst known as the “Attack Burst” and is considered to have been played by the engaged Creature controlled by the Striking Player. That player pays any costs associated with the Attack Card.",
    "7.2.5.3": "Once the Attack Card has been successfully played, the Striking Player receives priority to play abilities or Mugic and the Burst proceeds as normal.",
    "7.2.5.4": "When both players pass in order the Attack Burst resolves, and the Striking player receives priority. Once both players pass on an empty burst, the next player becomes the Striking player and this process is repeated until one creature leaves play and combat ends (see 7.3).",
    "7.3.1": "Combat will end when one player’s Creature leaves play (either by being destroyed, sacrificed, or by taking damage equal to or exceeding its Energy). When this occurs, all effects on the current Burst continue to resolve until that Burst is concluded. The one exception to this rule is if a player wins and the game ends (see section 5.0).",
    "7.3.2": "Combat can also end if both players play twenty consecutive attacks each without dealing damage. When this occurs, both engaged creatures are defeated and combat ends.",
    "7.3.3": "Once combat ends, the game returns to Active Player’s Action step.",
    "8.1.1": "Players may only play abilities or Mugic when allowed by the game rules. These opportunities are defined by the rules stating that the Active (or Non-Active) player is allowed to play abilities or Mugic. This is also referred to as a player receiving priority.",
    "8.1.2": "When allowed to by the game rules, the player with priority has the option to use Mugic or play a card ability. If the player chooses to use Mugic, or to play an activated ability, this starts a Burst or extends an existing Burst, which is handled as described below. Alternatively, the player with priority may “pass”. In this case the player’s opponent receives priority as above. If both players “pass” in succession then the opportunity to play abilities or Mugic has passed and the game progresses as described in the section for that particular game phase.",
    "8.2": "Bursts A Burst represents one or more unresolved Mugic or card abilities, which will resolve in the reverse order to which they were added to the Burst.",
    "8.2.1": "Starting a Burst: A Burst is started each time a player uses Mugic or plays a card ability. Bursts may also be started by certain card abilities that occur automatically at a time defined by that ability (For Example: At the beginning of combat). In addition the play of an Attack Card during the strike phase starts a Burst. The Mugic, Attack Card, or card ability used to start the Burst becomes the first effect in a given Burst.",
    "8.2.2.1": "Starting with the opponent of the player who started the Burst, players alternately decide to either extend the Burst by playing their own Mugic Card or ability, or to “pass”. If a player decides to pass then his or her opponent receives the choice to play a Mugic Card or ability, or to pass. If a player chooses to add a Mugic or ability to the Burst then the previous procedure repeats with his or her opponent receiving the first choice to extend the Burst. Otherwise, if both players choose to “pass” in a row, then the Burst will begin to resolve. Any Triggered Abilities generated during the resolution of the Burst are immediately added to the Burst, and both players (starting with the Active Player) will receive priority to respond with additional Mugic Cards or abilities. Additional effects are added to the Burst until both players pass consecutively, after which the Burst will continue to resolve.",
    "8.2.3.1": "Effects on a Burst will resolve in the reverse order to which they were added to the Burst. This is commonly referred to as “Last In, First Out” order. Starting with the most recently added ability or Mugic, the effect of each item on the Burst is completely resolved prior to the resolution of the next effect on the Burst.",
    "8.2.3.2": "When effects resolve the cards representing them are removed from the Burst. Resolved Mugic Cards are placed in the general discard pile and resolved Attack Cards are placed into the attack discard pile. Resolved card abilities, which have no physical card representation, are simply removed from the Burst.",
    "8.2.3.3": "During the resolution of a Burst no player receives priority to play abilities or Mugic unless a Triggered Ability is generated. Any abilities that trigger during the resolution of a Burst are handled as described below (see 8.3.4).",
    "8.2.3.4": "Once a Burst is fully resolved the active player receives priority to play Mugic or card abilities as per 9.1.",
    "8.2.3.5": "Card abilities in a Burst are independent of the card that created them. Destruction of this card will not remove the generated ability from the Burst or cause it to fail to resolve.",
    "8.3.1": "A Triggered Ability is one which gives a specific time or event which causes the ability to be triggered. When the indicated time or event occurs these abilities are added to the Burst. Typically Triggered Abilities are written in the format “When [event] ....” Or “At [time] ....”.",
    "8.3.2": "A Triggered Ability results in the creation of a Burst if one is not currently open. If more than one ability is triggered by the same game event then the Active Player adds his or her abilities to the Burst first. These can be added in any order. Then the Non-Active Player then adds abilities in a similar manner.",
    "8.3.3": "When more than one triggered ability would be added to the Burst at the same time, the **Active Player** adds all of theirs to the Burst in any order they choose. Then the non-Active Player adds their in any order they choose. Meaning the non-active player's abilities will always be on top.\nE.G. If it's your turn with your Numin, you choose how to order them. You put Numin on top of your element gain, Numin resolves first and then you get your element. If your opponent has Numin, they put any abilities after your Numin, and they lose their elements.\nSee Comprehensive Rules 8.3.3 and 7.2.3",
    "8.3.4": "If a Triggered Ability is generated while a Burst is being built, that ability is added to the Burst prior to either player being able to extend that Burst. If more then one ability is generated by the same game event then the Active Player adds all of his or her abilities in the order of his or her choice first followed by the Non-Active Player. The Burst can then be extended as normal following the procedure in 8.2.2 with the player who has the choice of action being the one who would have had that choice in the absence of the addition of Triggered Abilities.",

    "8.4.2.4": "Mugic Cards may have costs given on the Mugic Card in addition to the Mugic counter removal cost. If this is the case all additional costs must also be paid in order to play the Mugic Card. Game effects may also modify the number of Mugic counters that are required to play a Mugic.",
    "8.4.2.5": "Some Mugic Cards have a cost of 0. These Mugic Cards do not require the removal of a Mugic counter to play. However, these cards still require the player to select a Creature with the appropriate characteristics to play them.",
    "8.4.2.6": "If a Mugic Card has a cost of X this indicates that the cost of the Mugic is variable. When playing these Mugic Cards the casting player must decide a value for X as the Mugic is being declared. The cost of the Mugic becomes that chosen value and that number of counters must be removed from a Creature the casting player controls that shares a characteristic with the Mugic. Any text effects of the Mugic use the chosen value of X when it resolves.",

    "8.4.4.1": "All activated card abilities have an associated cost to perform. These costs can be Mugic counters, sacrifices, or other payments. In all cases, the cost must be paid in order to play the indicated ability.

    "8.5.2": "All instructions of the Mugic or ability are carried out in the order in which they are written. Any targets of the ability which are no longer valid can not be affected by any targeted portion of the resolving ability. Any instruction which references a Creature that is not associated with a specified target (for example “this Creature”) refers to the Creature which played the Mugic or ability.",
    "8.5.3": "Any damage dealt to a Creature is added to that Creature’s total damage. Damage dealt to a Creature is cumulative during a player’s turn. Damage is not removed from a Creature until the turn ends.",
    "8.5.4": "The amount of damage dealt by Mugic or an ability is determined as follows. First the Base Damage is modified by effects that increase damage. Any effects that add a specific amount of damage are calculated first, followed by any effects that multiply damage dealt. Then any effects that reduce damage are applied. These are applied in reverse order to the above with any division effects applied first followed by any effects that reduce the damage dealt by a specific number. Finally any effect that sets damage done to a specific number is applied.",
