			"It's easy with to give 4-6 of your opponent's creatures range and you win the game for 10 Mugic Counters. At most, this can take a couple of combats to happen, but some variants without banned cards can win before the first combat.",
			"She can one shot a deck, but still uses a spear"
		],
		"Arkanin": [
			"This deck has been pretty dominant with its combination of high flexibility and power, that flexibility with deck construction made this ultimately feel like what needed to be done. I'm aware the Arkanin ban might be unnecessary with one Ursis but I'm playing it safe on this one"
		],
		"Aszil, The Young Queen": [
			"She consistently gives her tribe earth. Removing the deck building restrictions of synergizing elements on creatures, without the downside of gear that grants elements or playing Mugic or abilities to give Earth. In addition, by having Hive active, your Mandiblors have Outperform Courage 5. She's purely value with no reason not to include her in an earth/courage deck. Other creatures that give resources have a cost."
		],
		"AZAIA Mindscrying Chamber": [
			"There's a lot of ways to remove elements. But this card's unilateral destruction of elements all but ensures a win for a discipline deck. You can't react to this one. It triggers on reveal, so location negating doesn't stop it. It's far reaching effect goes beyond a single Creature, paralizing other cards that rely on expending.",
			"We matched your element affinity to the state of your mind (hint: its empty)."
		],
		"Before the Storm": [
			"In the average Mipedian Invisibility: Strike deck, you'd see ~55 damage from this attack. Although not extraordinary damage. Since Mipedians also have access to cycling cards like Meditative Leap, Blaze Barrage and Synaptic Acceleration, combined with Before the Storm and their strike bonus, the decks' consistent damage output is too high."
		],
		"Bi-Mowercycle": [
			"This card is very meta warping, there are very few Battlegear that can go on support creatures and Bi-Mowercycle is the most consistently good. Bi-Mowercycle allows you to give any Creature Range and Swift without hindering their Battlegear choice. This results in it appearing in a lot of decks. Which means you almost always need to include Defender, since defenders aren't ubiquitous, this hinders deck variety.",
			"Zoom"
		],
		"Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher": [
			"Mostly due to his Expend Earth ability, there are a couple powerful combos. But the most potent is an combo involving Olkiex, Scout's Monocular, Lam'inkal, Destructozooka, and Droskin which prevents your opponent from using attacks.\nAnother option is using Jaidwarl and 2 Ikkatosh, Guardian of Nature to be able to use both of Bodal's ability 2 times after every combat win.",
			"Recycles battlegear better than Kybon's Scrapyard."
		],
		"Cadence Clash": [
			"Cadence Clash became a necessary card. To play a Mugic, you'd have to run two Cadence Clashes just to counter your opponent's two Cadence Clashes. When using Clash on a Clash, it returns to their hand, so now they can Clash the next Mugic you play too.",
			"They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy\nFun, fun, fun, fun, fun!",
			"If everyone has negate, no one has negate!"
		],
		"Chaac": [
			"Chaac, provides early game dominance by shutting down element based decks early game, combining this with the late game power of Fluidmorphing causes an overly consistent resource advantage. For example: with Em'swa in late games, makes Elemental decks unable to win, or with Mock'adyn to stall while building up healing.\n*(Previously Chaac had been allowed because M'arrillians were underwhelming compared to the other tribes.)*",
			"Chaac's bugs scare away your elements."
		],
		"Consuming Cacophony": [
			"Consuming Cacophony is loyal due to a combo involving Enre-hep High Muge of the Desert."
		],
		"Deadwater Devastation": [
			"It can severely hinder your opponent's Mugic abilty. Since most decks don't have ample Mugic counters, playing Deadwater Devastation early game cripples their options. Fluidmorph decks that play Deadwater Devastation disproportionately effect non-Fluidmorph decks since they generate Mugic counters.",
			"Big Splash."
		],
		"Dranakis Threshold": [
			"Dranakis Threshold prevents interaction outside of playing attacks. Decks that focus on Attacks as their win condition (namely Mipedian Strike) can use this lack of interaction to effectively guarantee a win with this location. This card is very frustrating to play against by reducing a turn to who had better attack draws.",
			"Tried to circumvent the Zamool ban.",
			"Advanced Apprentice the location."
		],
		"Dror'niq": [
			"His first ability allows him to deal 10 damage for 1 Mugic Counter, and when he's stored up enough counters, he can one-shot opposing engaged Creatures.\nAlthough his second ability takes 4 Mugic Counters, he can use it while unengaged and it essentially provides Recklessness 10 for 30-50 damage in a typical combat.",
			"One shot, one code."
		],
		"Elemental Denial": [
			"Its splashable inclusion in Mixed decks allows an easy way to surpress opponents playstyle with limited cost to their own deck."
		],
		"Elemental Elegy": [
			"This card allows Danains to shoot down elemental attacks, which can guarantee a combat win if the opposing creature doesn't have a way to gain elements. The decision to remove Element hate from a tribe which already has a lot of flexibility in deck building was made to reduce the power of Danians abd reduce prominence of Element hate in meta.",
			"Danians plagiarized both the OverWorld and UnderWorld."
		],
		"Em'swa": [
			"In pauper, renewable resources such as fluidmorphers tend to be too be too strong. Combined with Chaac to cover the early game, Em'swa all but ensures that you're opponent won't be playing elemental attacks. Additionaly, since Chaac, in pauper, doesn't have other ways to be renewable, Em'swa made more sense as the choice."	
		],
		"Enre-hep, High Muge of the Desert": [
			"Enre-hep has the ability to remove unique from any Mugic. He combos well with expensive Mugic cast from one of his teammates and copying it multiple times for high value. The most oppressive combos are: Tonal Destruction, Unheard Melody, Consuming Cacophony, Song of Resistance (which can stall a game for hours), and finally a broken combo involves Strain of Infection and Ode to Obscurity to create a loop to generate infinite counters.",
			"Some reasearch is better left buried in the sand."
		],
		"Garv": [
			"Garv is a card that is both powerful and popular. Its flexibility in disable opponents battlegear or revealing your own battlegear generates a lot of value. Specifically used in Uris Burn to disable opponent's anti-burn battlegear and to flip up unengaged creature's burn."
		],
		"Ginar'rash, The Extinguisher": [
			"Similarly to Illusionary Lake, this card can create an inability to have and gain Fire. As long as you play consistent water attacks, your opponent will not be able to play fire attacks."
		],
		"Grounding Grapple": [
			"Grounding Grapple lets you reorder your top three locations, **and** reveal a new location. Unlike the other attacks that reveal a new location, this does not have the cost of losing earth."
		],
		"Headmaster Ankhyja, Seeker of the Art": [
			"Prevents opponent's interaction with your creatures leading to less strategic games. Stunts decks that rely on targeting opponents."
		],
		"Hiadrom": [
			"Hiadrom in Aszil Compost has been an extremely strong deck for a long time, so this change is meant to weaken that deck. Irrabeq as good replacement should keep the deck playable."
		],
		"Hive Amber": [
			"See Hive Unsung"
		],
		"Hive Unsung": [
			"When combined with Ramarhvir the Hivebringer, Hive Unsung can be used in an infinite combo to allow a one turn win."
		],
		"Hune Paltanin": [
			"She provides massive healing potential to OverWorld decks. Her ability has no cost, so her inclusion in decks is resource advantage and completely counters burn archtypes.",
			"Foxy Waifu"
		],
		"Ice Disks": [
			"Decks have been this and Whirling Wail to limit opponent's ability to interact. By limiting this attack, decks should have more opportunity to utalize their resoures"
		],
		"Ikkatosh, The Aich King": [
			"His ability gives significant advantage to cards that were already designed strong to offset their lack of elements. Cards like Aivenna and Anarkiar surpass other fighters with the extraordinary energy and Outperform.",
			"Is a tree"
		],
		"Illusionary Lake": [
			"Water is the most common element in the game. This location's preventing the gain of Water ensures a win against any deck that relies on Water.",
			"Water doesn't work here. Your body is 60% water. When Illusionary Lake is revealed, you'll automatically die."
		],
		"Imaginary Walls": [
			"Reducing 10 damage per attack is strong. Even a modest energy M'arrillian or Minion could be able to take 4 or more attacks than usual because of the reduction.\nReturning a Mugic is not a sufficient benefit for the opposing player to counter-act the battle's damage reduction.",
			"Psst, just walk through the wall. It doesn't exist."
		],
		"Improvisational Melody": [
			"Underworld burn was a serious issue for the pauper format, especially with there ability to play 3 free mugic."
		],
		"Inner Flood": [
			"It's been the best 0bp in the game by alot for quite a while, the ability to move counters off of creatures who can make them (popularly fluidmorphers) onto creatures who can use them for ability was always potent but so was messing with your opponents ability to play mugic or activated abilities by moving there counters around in annoying ways, all while not having to commit to untill the attack resolves. Frankly the effect is stronger than alot of 1bp attacks often."
		],
		"Interlude of Interruption": [
			"Interlude of Interruption allows OverWorlders to cheaply counter opponents. Because of its low cost, this Mugic is often included into mixed decks containing OverWorlders. Since both mixed and OverWorld decks lean towards activated abilities and contain ample Mugic counters, running this Mugic can prevent an opponents strategy without drawback.",
			"Pay the toll"
		],
		"Lanker": [
			"Lanker grants disciplines on demand. His ability is not limited to once per turn. If you use his ability until he has 5 energy remaining, he can increase stats for at least 5 times ((30-5)/5) per turn. Giving their engaged Creature the ability to prevent your challenges, win initiatives, and any other benefits of obscenely high disciplines.\nA common strategy is to equip Lanker with Kha'rall Husk Armor. So by giving him this additional energy you distribute (30+50-5)/5 x 15 (225) worth of disciplines.",
			"Too... much... passing..."
		],
		"Lord Van Bloot, Servant of Aa'une": [
			"Element Attacks are close to half the Attacks in the game, and having a whole deck built around them is common. Other cards remove elements, but Bloot's preventing element gain clause means element decks lose without high courage.",
			"Bowser steals your stars, Lord van Bloot steals your elements.",
			"Its okay, you think, your opponent queued up with a discipline based deck.",
			"His sickle is just compensating"
		],
		"Lore": [
			"Mixed burn decks continued to dominate the meta. Removing the incremental damage available at any time reduces the risk of dying when a creature is too low in health and cannot respond to many additional instances of burn chained on the burst."
		],
		"Lore, Ancestral Caller": [
			"Decks that rely on discard interaction, (Danian compost, Mipedian Glost, OverWorld Strain of the Tide, M'arrillian Psi-mageddon, etc.) instantly lose their combo against Lore. Unlike other cards that remvoe Creatures from the discard, Lore's ability to gain Mugic counters furthers the disparity in matchups. And unlike Kileron, Lore's ability only applies to the opponent. Additionaly, since Lore has an activated ability on which to spend these counters, has the energy and disciplines of a fighter, and has subtype Muge, the combination of factors pushes him into the overbearing territory and makes Danian burn too powerful.",
			"He was arrested for grave robbery."
		],
		"Lore, High Muge of the Hive": [
			"Lore allows you to get extra use out of Mugic and can push a Mugic's potency over the line. Common targets are one cost Mugics such as Caster's Warsong and Song of Symmetry. Lore's ability becomes oppressive with Mugic like Tonal Destruction and Strain of Infection. Either by easily stripping away your opponent's Mugic hand, or by a huge resource boost on an activated ability like Ulmquad and Lobanne.",
			"Broke out of jail."
		],
		"Lore's Chamber of Recall": [
			"Lore's Chamber of Recall provides an instantaneous game swing against decks that rely on the discard. Although it is not included in many decks outside of UnderWorld Burn archtype, the possibility that it could be included in a deck discourages compost decks from being played.",
			"Sorry, the truck already emptied the recycle bin."
		],
		"Makanaz": [
			"Makanaz is an overstatted creature with an effect that continues providing vast value even after your opponent manages to kill it. In pauper, in addition to the overall weaker card pool, there is only one option: Void Dirge."
		],
		"Malvadine, The King's Herald": [
			"His high stats, and ability to defend, make him essential in any mono-Mipedian deck. He has strike and Air 5, which makes him versitile in practically all deck types."
		],
		"Melody of Mirage": [
			"In the effort to reduce the power of Mipedian decks, Melody of Mirage is limited."
		],
		"Melody of the Meek": [
			"Taking only 10 damage from every source is brutal. Even with only 30 energy this card would be a big advantage.\nBut there's tons of effects Creatures gain energy - making it difficult to kill a Creature using this Mugic.",
			"See Strike of the Meek"
		],
		"Mind Mash": [
			"The Overworld deck has been very potent and that is partially do to it's use of this attack. 60 damage is enough to win a battle almost single handedly and Tartarek on the team makes it not too hard to get that almost every time. When combined with the denial mugic the Overworld has and the use of Garv to remove things like Xerium Armor, the regular counterplay to giant attacks like this wasn't as effective. Overall I decided those cards were more popular and widely used than this one so they'll be staying and this will be going"
		],
		"Mipedim Mirage": [
			"Mipedim Mirage provides a huge swings. While its swift is not always relevant, revealing it later in the game can let a fighter reach an exposed backline, which forces people to make less valuable creature placement in the off chance that it gets revealed.\nThe strongest aspect of this location is its mirage effect. Manipulating your opponent's next combat and reducing their autonomy to attack."
		],
		"Mock'adyn": [
			"Mock'adyn's ability to build counters and heal renewability outpaces almost all decks. When played well, it even stablizes against super aggro builds and then there's little chance of winning against its value."
		],
		"Na-inna": [
			"Na-inna can mess with your opponent by moving Counters from the Creatures that could utilize. But its real benefit is moving Counters to cards that should be limited on Mugic Counters. Often times combined with a fluidmorpher."
		],
		"Najarin, Fluidmorphers' Foe": [
			"Plenty of card like Heptagon Hail, Chimegrid and Baladeer's Flute allow Najarin to get a plenty of Mugic Counters. Then being able to spend these Counters to give Creatures Energy is strong. This becomes worse When fighting a deck that gains Mugic Counters such as Fluidmorphers.\nBut if that's not bad enough, he shuts down any M'arrillian deck with a built in Refrain of Denial.",
			"Najarin is actually a minion along with Tarterek. Unlike Tarterek who became a Warbeast, and Uksum who became a Kha'rall, Najarin became a fluidmorpher."
		],
		"Neekwin": [
			"Simply put, Neekwin contains too many good things. He has the build of a fighter (2 elements, relevant disciplines, high energy) while getting \"Untargetable\" and Water 5 when unequipped. Because he's incentivized for not having a Battlegear equipped, he is run with sacrifice gear and when revived automatically gets these benefits. Speaking about revival, he has the subtype \"Mandiblor\", which enables him to be revived through multiple tribe mechanics. Additionally, he benefits from cards that boost Mandiblors. Combined with the many utilities in the Danian tribe, he's a card worthy of his flavor text.",
			"I'm sure you've seen him in a deck by now",
			"Oh you thought this was over?",
			"Neekwin is spelled with **win**",
			"Yeah, I know you're mad about this.",
			"It's in his flavor text..."
		],
		"Numin Voidland": [
			"Discipline supremacy is solidified here. It provides an unfair advantage against decks that rely on elemental attacks for their attack damage.",
			"Your attacks, just like your chances at winning, are now **void**."
		],
		"Ode to Obscurity": [
			"Combined with Fliander, Danian Carapace, and a Fluidmorpher to cast Ode to Obscurity at a higher cost, this Mugic enabled Fliander to heal 100s of energy. Especially when paired with Carnivore's Keening which causes Fliander to self infect from Recklessness."
		],
		"Olkiex' Apron": [
			"Strike utalizes Apron to remove threats from the opponent with very little cost to their own creatures. Since Malvadine has so much value, for example, the benifit of removing the opponent's extra energy or Xerium Armor makes them closer to two shot range."
		],
		"Phelphor, Of the Deep": [
			"Phelphor's ability to stall out games, and disrupt opponent's creature placement caused Phelphor to become the defacto fluidmorpher for mixed decks. This reduction of the opponents agency creates a frustrating matchup. Restricting Phelphor to M'arrillians should help reduce the power of frustrating mixed decks while boosting M'arrillians."
		],
		"Phlogiston": [
			"Burn is divisive, while both being heavily played and hated. Banning Phlogiston should help reduce some of the overbearing variance without gutting existing burn decks."
		],
		"Psionic Serenade": [
			"This card makes use of an already defeated resource to swing the tempo of a match. High energy minions are already present throughout the meta, giving their decks another tool can make them too strong. Dealing usually 55-65 damage, this all but guarentines a combat win.",
			"The M'arrillians learned a better use for dead creatures than revival like the UnderWorlders."
		],
		"Pouril Forest": [
			"Defender is crucial in a lot of decks to protect your support creatures. Pouril Forest early on can allow a player to get a huge advantage by sniping key Creatures."
		],
		"Prexxor Chasm": [
			"It's very punishing to players whose support are less capable of fighting it gets around any counterplay such as defender or location hate and an important factor it allows the person using it to have 2 combats on their turn."
		],
		"Prexxor Chasm, The Blight": [
			"The Blight is a card that provides a huge swing to a game. Burn (especially UnderWorld) presents a huge threat to decks, and running cards that heal/gain energy (most commonly Carnivore's Keening) are essential in that matchup. Additionally, its mirage effect is effectively 20 damage for the next turn. An early game (first or second turn) Prexxor Chasm invalidates protections against UnderWorld Burn and turns an otherwise advantaged deck into a loss through removing critical support creatures or fighters.",
			"If you look at the bottom of the chasm, you can see where Proboscar fell."
		],
		"Royal Mipedian Academy of Melee Arts": [
			"This card stops burn for a turn, so removing the chance of this happening should make burn more consistent."
		],
		"Primal Smash": [
			"20 Damage for 1 Build Point with no condition is valued far above other Attacks. Competitive decks become better with its inclusion (especially non-elemental based). Decks that would not include it become worse off compared to the competitive ones and deck archtypes like Bodal's Dagger would still remain worse against top tier decks.",
			"Hulk's ***SMASH*** is bigger"
		],
		"Ramarhvir, The Danian Hivebringer": [
			"Ramarhvir, enables Danains resurrection to be it enables Danains resurrection to be too efficient and makes it very difficult to overcome (the game drags on). Combined with Hive Unsung can also be used in an infinite combo to allow a one turn win.",
			"If you have an afternoon to waste, try out the infinite combo.",
			"And you thought Yu-Gi-Oh had grave interaction?"
		],
		"Rao'Pa Sahkk, Condensation Ceremony": [
			"Easily shuts down Mipedian and UnderWorld decks. And hinders many support Creatures in OverWorld and Danian tribes. Being unable to play Mugic or Abilities gives Creatures with Water overwhelming advantage.",
			"*At least Fluidmorphers are having fun at the beach.*"
		],
		"Refrain of Denial": [
			"To shift the meta but giving a wider range of decks access to negation, Refrain of Denial would be switched with Interlude of Interruptions. Having both at the same time could be overbearing."
		],
		"Rhyme of the Reckless": [
			"Rhyme of the Reckless is punishing Mugic, especially against Mipedians. By limiting accessablility to OverWorld, loyal decks can remain powerful, without boosting mixed effectiveness against Mipedians."
		],
		"Skeletal Springs": [
			"This location not only prevents Fluidmorphing, but it also acts like Dranakis Threshold for them. The compensation? Water 5. Most players running this location use it in a Water deck. So a boost for the player and a potential game breaker for the opponent."
		],
		"Song of Transportation": [
			"Allows you to simply change the opponent's active location to your active location. This card doesn't see much play simply because the overwelming options present in the Mipedian Mugic collection."
		],
		"Song of Resistance": [
			"Song of Resistance is generally an underwhelming card. Certain players have built decks that utalize it to create a combat that does not end until they choice to end it. This type of deck is labled as \"kidnap\". Because Chaotic does not have an adequate rule that prevents unending combats (attacks played limit), kidnap decks will build counters over time using Fluidmorphing and Mugic counter transfering to an activated ability that eventually wins the game. This process is slow and frustrating for the opposening player, due to the length of time it takes before the win condition is met.\nIf \"Glacier Plains, M'arrillian Heat Cannon\" is added to recode or an attack limit rule is implemented, this ban will be reconsidered."
		],
		"Strain of Infection": [
			"It allows decks to easily increase their resources and it's an enabler for oppresive combinations, such as building high number of Mugic counters on Lobanne (thanks to Lore, High Muge), or in burn to easily refuel Ulmquad damage. Enre-hep, High Muge most breaks this card by creating a loop to generate infinite counters.",
			"Since Danians can turn infected creatures into Mugic counters, I wonder if M'arrillians could turn minions into Mugic counters..."
		],
		"Supercooled Rain": [
			"Removing 4 Mugic Counters severely cripples most decks. Aside from a couple of cards that negate attacks, it is not preventable.",
			"Your opponent didn't need Mugic Counters anyway.",
			"Nothing like a nice super cool shower to wash off the dirt from a hard days work"
		],
		"Talisman of the Mandiblor": [
			"You spend resources taking out their strong Mandiblor fighter, just to have it come back at the price of a support creature. The Creature can be placed anywhere on the board, allowing them to jump next to their opponents support creatures. Additionally, because it can be sacrificed at any time, it can be used to \"skip\" your opponent's turn: after they engage, you activate it and waste their combat and bring back a fighter.",
			"This talisman brings bad luck to any Danian that wears it. But very good luck to mandiblors."
		],
		"Tartarek, Psi Overloader": [
			"Tartarek is a Warbeast-like creature without Recklessness. On top of two Mugicians, and a decent Wisdom increasing Ability. On his own a very playable card, two Elements, two very good Disciplines, good Energy and two Mugic Counters.\nOn top of an already good card, his effect lets you easily destroy a play style involving Chieftains. To add insult to injury, Tartarek's Brainwashed ability is the same. ",
			"His ability is the perfect cover. Who would suspect a guy whose abilities never change?",
			"Chaotic canonically exists in the TMNT universe"
		],
		"Tonal Destruction": [
			"This card is good if you just want to limit your opponent. But gets out of hand when combined with Enre-hep, High Muge or Lore, High Muge by allowing you to strip 4+ of the Mugic from your opponent's hand.",
			"If I can't have Mugic, you can't either."
		],
		"Twister of Elements": [
			"This allows a deck to get away with an unbalanced attack deck. They can focus on multiple high build point attacks without the normal tradeoff of drawing through bad attacks. Additionally, by going through their attack deck faster, they can play the same high impact attacks more frequently than a deck that does not include Twister of Elements.",

			"In Standard, Burn has been consistently too strong. With Ulmar, deck's access to renewable burn allowed it to out-value a lot of decks. Restricting Ulmar to UnderWorld is a good way to keep the tribe's power without having burn be rampant in mixed decks.\nIn Pauper, having 20 renewable damage each turn proves to be overwhelming against the resources in other decks. In addition, Ulmar can cast both Cannon of Casuality or Caster's Warsong making it invaluable in pauper burn decks dominance."

		"Ulmquad": [
			"Ulmquad has one of the best 1mc activated abilities in the game doing a massive 20 energy swing while engaged. Not only that he is able to use his ability while unengaged, which is particularly punishing with how Chaotics rules system interacting with smaller burn damage, because you can die mid burst if you ever get low enough on energy even as high 30, no amount of energy gain can save you if your opponent chains their Ulmquad's ability and they have a large enough stack of counters. Ulmquad makes any effect that gives mugic counters much stronger, as he is the best place to put them."

Yes some creatures could hold onto there MC to avoid dying but not everyone had tha luxury, especially with Na-inna around so this mugic is being benched."

			"Against the typical opponent, this Battlegear makes them unable to play their best attacks to maximum damage against big damage decks (like Strike or Element X). With a high Energy Creature, it takes a long time to defeat it.\nThe downsides are it isn't effective against match-ups which do consistent 15-20 Damage attacks, and Battlegear removal/flipping abilities keep it in check.",

		"Primal Smash": "The biggest issue is that the decks that wouldn't benefit from their archetype by using primal are also inherently either low or not even on the tier list because the structure of the better and higher tier meta decks relies on something that isnt just attack value. War beast and strike are worth less than  even a moderately refined deck of wise guys. And while some war beast variant decks lose on primal, wise guys gains. So it would actually create a larger power disparity than already exists. And would reduce deck variety to boot because primal would become an active meta staple to help ensure remaining competitive against other meta decks.\nThe decks that do not benefit from primal already dont have enough going for them to break into higher tiers. Releasing primal does nothing for them. And only hurts them by boosting the power of many decks that are already more competitively viable."
